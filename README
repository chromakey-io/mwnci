This is the engine for my personal website and a few that i've made for friends.

I've tried to make it as flexible as possible.  You can create pages and page-types.  You can have a main page for each type, and the rest are all sub-pages ... ie:

/about/
  /about/hamburgers/
  /about/cheese/

There is also a wigdets module that allows you to attach media or html modules to pages.  You can order and position them.

There are also "themes".  This just allows you to upload your own django template ... and attach it to pages you want to have rendered against said template.

There's also a articles app, I don't remember what it does ... probably something like a blog .. .haven't tested/used it yet... heh.

Some stuff I didn't include in the repo cause it's public...

/libararies contains johnny  lumberjack  memcache.py  memcache.pyc  memcache_status  south

django, spawning, and eventlet all live in the base directory.

/bin has startup scripts for spawning in it

If anyone actually uses this ... um tell me how to make it actually useful for someone other than me... and I will.
